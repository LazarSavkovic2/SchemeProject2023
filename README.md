# SchemeProject2023

Translated the Java-derived application into Scheme, showcasing the transition from 

object-oriented and procedural paradigms to a purely functional approach. Embraced Schemeâ€™s expressive syntax to refactor iterative processes into recursive 

functions, demonstrating the power of functional programming in handling complex 

control structures. Implemented recursion as a core looping mechanism, a testament to Scheme's 

capacity for elegant functional iteration without traditional loop constructs.
